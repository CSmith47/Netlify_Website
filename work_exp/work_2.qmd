### What is the UCLA Store?

The UCLA Store is the primary service destination for all UCLA students. With many locations on campus, students can find everything from UCLA merchandise, clothing, food, books, and, most importantly for me, technology support. One of the stores inside one of these UCLA Store locations is the UCLA Computer Store with the TechZone, which is where I worked. As a technician in the TechZone, I am Apple certified, meaning that I can repair and service any Apple device that is brought in for any issue. Beyond just Apple products, our store also handles devices from other manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Dell, and HP. I frequently use the problem-solving and diagnostic skills that I have developed while working at this job to apply it to statistical projects. 

### My Achievements at the UCLA Store

While working as a technician at the UCLA store, I was able to accomplish the following:

- Worked collaboratively in a team of 1-3 members in an Apple authorized repair store to provide exceptional customer service,
frequently resolving technical issues for customers the same day they visit the store.
- Performed over 100 repairs as an Apple Certified Technician, addressing hardware and software issues for Apple devices as
well as other brands, including Microsoft, Dell, and HP.
- Leveraged strong troubleshooting and diagnostic skills to efficiently address problems and present solutions to customers,
fostering a reputation for reliability and competence in problem solving.
