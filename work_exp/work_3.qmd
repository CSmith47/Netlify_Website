### What is Exodus Escape Room?

Exodus Escape Room is an escape room business located in California. An escape room is a locked room filled with a series of unique challenges and puzzles that must be solved by the players before a timer runs out. Exodus prioritizes quality customer service and family-friendly puzzles, often hosting large groups to complete their rooms. While an employee there, I often worked in small teams of two or three. I frequently use the collaboration skills I learned in these small teams to work with similarly sized teams when completing a statistical analysis project. Additionally, the quick-thinking and problem-solving nature that I developed to quickly deal with props that break before the next group is set to complete their game aided in my projects as well.
