### What is Edwards Lifesciences?

With a main headquarters in Irvine, California, Edwards Lifesciences is a global company with one, simple goal, to extend the lives of others. Edwards specializes in technology relating to the structure of the heart, primarily heart valves, which help those with a failing heart, or other heart issues, live longer. With such an important purpose to aid the lives of other fighting cardiovascular diseases, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to assist in their goals. 

### My Achievements at Edwards

While working as an intern at Edwards Lifesciences, I was able to accomplish the following:

- Collaborated with senior data analyst to perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction on 7 datasets from 2 clinical
studies, merging and comparing data for analysis on a device used across both studies.
- Extensively utilized R for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation of large clinical datasets, exporting them to SAS for
submission to the FDA, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
- Validated the integrity and accuracy of clinical datasets by cross-checking with study documentation, identifying a critical
discrepancy that had gone unnoticed for 3 years, improving data quality.
