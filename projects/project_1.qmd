### Project Summary

This project is focused around the utilization of model tuning and SHAP values to uncover important insights into the factors that influence whether a college quarterback gets drafted by a team into the NFL or not. The goal of the project is to tune various machine learning models to accompany imbalanced data, and to best predict whether a college quarterback will be drafted into the NFL based on widely available statistics. Then, the usage of SHAP values can illustrate the best picture of the statistics that are most impactful to a quarterback's draft status. During the project, I was able to demonstrate how weighted and undersampled models could provide not only better results than the imbalanced data, but could also strategically bias the model into favoring one class or another based on the project objective. Additionally, I was able to utilize SHAP values to not only demonstate the most impactful statistics, but also created a weighted statistics to make the interpretations of these SHAP values easier. Ultimately, a scouting team for the NFL could use the insights I uncovered during this project to significantly narrow down the list of college quarterbacks they need to scout in an efficient manner. 

### My Achievements Upon Completing the Project

While working on the project, I was able to accomplish the following:

- Processed and transformed a dataset of 1,639 observations using Python to enhance model performance and extract insights.
- Developed and fine-tuned 7 machine learning models using Scikit-learn, utilizing weights and undersampling to balance the models and achieve an increase in F1-Score by up to 12%.
- Created 7 interactive visualizations with Matplotlib to illustrate feature interactions and their impact on player draft prediction.
- Engineered a weighted performance metric to enhance SHAP value interpretability, improving model explainability for college quarterback predictions.
- Synthesized key findings into a poster presentation, effectively communicating insights to a non-technical audience.
