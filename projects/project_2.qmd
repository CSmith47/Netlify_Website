### Project Summary

This project is focused around the utilization of sentiment analysis and natural language processing to uncover important topics and issues that customers express in their Yelp reviews. The goal of this project is to leverage these topics, in terms of importance to the customer and their resulting star rating, to identify how a business could improve their ratings by adjusting what the customers desire to be adjusted the most. During the project, I demonstrated how the complexity of human language often made it difficult to decipher whether a review was positive or negative by the words alone (sometimes a "positive sounding" review was actually negative and vice versa). To counteract this complexity, I leveraged a BERTopic model to best classify the Yelp reviews by their star ratings while also viewing which topics were most important to the customers when leaving their reviews. I was also able to demonstrate how the importance of these topics often changed over time, and between different types of businesses. Ultimately, a motivated company could leverage my insights during this project to improve their overall star ratings. 

### My Achievements Upon Completing the Project

While working on the project, I was able to accomplish the following:

- Trained a BERTopic model across 3 distinct types of business reviews aiming to enhance business performance through
topic-driven insights.
- Generated 6 distinct visualizations using BERTopic to illustrate the relationships between topics, their variations based on
star ratings, and the evolution of topic importance over time.
- Utilized a VADER sentiment analysis model to visualize and interpret review sentiment to explain the nuances and
inconsistencies of natural language application using data-driven processes.
- Constructed a logistic regression model with Scikit-learn to demonstrate the power of sentence transformers in capturing
complex language patterns for predictive modeling and analysis.
- Penned an in-depth analysis of my findings through an article posted on the Medium platform that was subsequently
published by the platform: [Python in Plain English](https://python.plainenglish.io/)
