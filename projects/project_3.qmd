### Project Summary

This project is focused around the utilization of machine learning models and model importances to uncover the factors that contribute to wins in the Overwatch League. The goal of this project was to leverage model insights to find the best playstyles, and by consequence the best players, of the Overwatch League. During the project, I demonstrated how the usage of exploratory data analysis and feature importances could help find the best playstyle. With knowledge of the best playstyle, I created a weighted statistic that utilized these feature importances to find the best players within the Overwatch league as a whole, and by role. Ultimately, a motivated player could leverage the information I uncovered to adjust their own playstyle to be more optimal and get better results in game. 


### My Achievements Upon Completing the Project

While working on the project, I was able to accomplish the following:

- Uploaded a dataframe with over one million rows into a SQL database for efficient exploration and inquiry into the data
- Combined, reduced, and simplified large, complex dataframes, such as the one above, to create two more easily-accessible
dataframes for public use
- Feature engineered a completely new, weighted statistic to analyze individual player performance and predict game wins and
losses with high accuracy
- Constructed a random tree classifier model using the Scikit-learn library to predict map victories based on team and player
statistics
- Generated 20 visualizations, 18 of which display statistical variations among teamsâ€™ performances and 2 of which show the
most important factors of the model
- Penned an in-depth analysis of my findings through an article posted on the Medium platform
