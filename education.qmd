## Major

- B.S. in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/)  
- *Expected Graduation: December 2025*

## Motivation

I chose UCLA not only for its beautiful sceneries and lovely weather, but for its ability to compliment my practical knowledge of implementing machine learning models with the statistical theory behind how they function through its rigorous curriculum. While coding skills can be acquired through online courses, a deep understanding of statistical models requires more than syntax, it demands knowledge of underlying assumptions, limitations, and proper applications. At UCLA, I developed the ability to critically assess and implement models with statistical integrity, ensuring that the insights I generate are both valid and impactful. This strong theoretical foundation, combined with hands-on experience, has prepared me to approach real-world data challenges with confidence and precision.
