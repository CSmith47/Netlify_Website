While coding skills can be acquired through online courses, a deep understanding of statistical models requires more than syntax, it demands knowledge of underlying assumptions, limitations, and proper applications. At UCLA, I developed the ability to critically assess and implement models with statistical integrity, ensuring that the insights I generate are both valid and impactful. This strong theoretical foundation, combined with hands-on experience, has prepared me to approach real-world data challenges with confidence and precision."
