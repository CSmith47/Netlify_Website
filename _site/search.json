    "text": "What is the UCLA Store?\nThe UCLA Store is the primary service destination for all UCLA students. With many locations on campus, students can find everything from UCLA merchandise, clothing, food, books, and, most importantly for me, technology support. One of the stores inside one of these UCLA Store locations is the UCLA Computer Store with the TechZone, which is where I worked. As a technician in the TechZone, I am Apple certified, meaning that I can repair and service any Apple device that is brought in for any issue. Beyond just Apple products, our store also handles devices from other manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Dell, and HP. I frequently use the problem-solving and diagnostic skills that I have developed while working at this job to apply it to statistical projects.\n\n\nMy Achievements at the UCLA Store\nWhile working as a technician at the UCLA store, I was able to accomplish the following:\n\nWorked collaboratively in a team of 1-3 members in an Apple authorized repair store to provide exceptional customer service, frequently resolving technical issues for customers the same day they visit the store.\nPerformed over 100 repairs as an Apple Certified Technician, addressing hardware and software issues for Apple devices as well as other brands, including Microsoft, Dell, and HP.\nLeveraged strong troubleshooting and diagnostic skills to efficiently address problems and present solutions to customers, fostering a reputation for reliability and competence in problem solving."

    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project is focused around the utilization of sentiment analysis and natural language processing to uncover important topics and issues that customers express in their Yelp reviews. The goal of this project is to leverage these topics, in terms of importance to the customer and their resulting star rating, to identify how a business could improve their ratings by adjusting what the customers desire to be adjusted the most. During the project, I demonstrated how the complexity of human language often made it difficult to decipher whether a review was positive or negative by the words alone (sometimes a “positive sounding” review was actually negative and vice versa). To counteract this complexity, I leveraged a BERTopic model to best classify the Yelp reviews by their star ratings while also viewing which topics were most important to the customers when leaving their reviews. I was also able to demonstrate how the importance of these topics often changed over time, and between different types of businesses. Ultimately, a motivated company could leverage my insights during this project to improve their overall star ratings.\n\n\nMy Achievements Upon Completing the Project\nWhile working on the project, I was able to accomplish the following:\n\nTrained a BERTopic model across 3 distinct types of business reviews aiming to enhance business performance through topic-driven insights.\nGenerated 6 distinct visualizations using BERTopic to illustrate the relationships between topics, their variations based on star ratings, and the evolution of topic importance over time.\nUtilized a VADER sentiment analysis model to visualize and interpret review sentiment to explain the nuances and inconsistencies of natural language application using data-driven processes.\nConstructed a logistic regression model with Scikit-learn to demonstrate the power of sentence transformers in capturing complex language patterns for predictive modeling and analysis.\nPenned an in-depth analysis of my findings through an article posted on the Medium platform that was subsequently published by the platform: Python in Plain English\n\nPlease click on the GitHub and Article links below if you would like to learn more about this project:"

While coding skills can be acquired through online courses, a deep understanding of statistical models requires more than syntax, it demands knowledge of underlying assumptions, limitations, and proper applications. At UCLA, I developed the ability to critically assess and implement models with statistical integrity, ensuring that the insights I generate are both valid and impactful. This strong theoretical foundation, combined with hands-on experience, has prepared me to approach real-world data challenges with confidence and precision."

    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project is focused around the utilization of model tuning and SHAP values to uncover important insights into the factors that influence whether a college quarterback gets drafted by a team into the NFL or not. The goal of the project is to tune various machine learning models to accompany imbalanced data, and to best predict whether a college quarterback will be drafted into the NFL based on widely available statistics. Then, the usage of SHAP values can illustrate the best picture of the statistics that are most impactful to a quarterback’s draft status. During the project, I was able to demonstrate how weighted and undersampled models could provide not only better results than the imbalanced data, but could also strategically bias the model into favoring one class or another based on the project objective. Additionally, I was able to utilize SHAP values to not only demonstate the most impactful statistics, but also created a weighted statistics to make the interpretations of these SHAP values easier. Ultimately, a scouting team for the NFL could use the insights I uncovered during this project to significantly narrow down the list of college quarterbacks they need to scout in an efficient manner.\n\n\nMy Achievements Upon Completing the Project\nWhile working on the project, I was able to accomplish the following:\n\nProcessed and transformed a dataset of 1,639 observations using Python to enhance model performance and extract insights.\nDeveloped and fine-tuned 7 machine learning models using Scikit-learn, utilizing weights and undersampling to balance the models and achieve an increase in F1-Score by up to 12%.\nCreated 7 interactive visualizations with Matplotlib to illustrate feature interactions and their impact on player draft prediction.\nEngineered a weighted performance metric to enhance SHAP value interpretability, improving model explainability for college quarterback predictions.\nSynthesized key findings into a poster presentation, effectively communicating insights to a non-technical audience.\n\nPlease click on the poster link below if you would like to learn more about this project:"
